## Data processing

- [ ] Load in DISCO data (text, authorial metadata)
- [ ] Extract n-gram features with relevant libraries
- [ ] Extract rhyme schema with relevant libraries
- [ ] Split into train, val, test

## SVM Classification

- [ ] Build (binary) classifier for gender
- [ ] Build multiclass classifier for country
- [ ] Build multiclass classifier for time period

## Bi-LSTM

- [ ] Decide on pre-trained word embeddings for Spanish
- [ ] Build classifier for gender
- [ ] Build classifier for country
- [ ] Build classifier for time period

## BETO (BERT architecture)

- [ ] Finetune BETO on gender classification
- [ ] Finetune BETO on country classification
- [ ] Finetune BETO on time period classification

## Ensemble models (if time)

- [ ] Combine SVM with finetuned BETO
- [ ] Combine Bi-LSTM with finetuned BETO
